# Deep Learning Model Development

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect driver inattention from image data. Although the baseline CNN architecture demonstrates promising results, it encounters challenges such as overfitting, limited feature extraction capability, and suboptimal generalization to unseen data. To address these limitations, this study investigates advanced CNN architectures, hybrid deep learning models, and optimized training strategies aimed at improving model accuracy and robustness. The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 80%, demonstrating its potential for reliable driver inattention detection. 

The research methodology comprises four key stages, including:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and identify potential biases.
  - Preprocessing, including feature extraction and encoding, to enhance input quality and representation.
  - Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize model configuration and performance.
  - Transfer Learning to leverage pre-trained networks for better generalization and efficiency.
